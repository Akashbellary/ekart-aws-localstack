# EKart Store - LocalStack Tutorial Edition

A comprehensive e-commerce platform demonstrating multi-service AWS architectures using LocalStack. This tutorial showcases how to build and test complex cloud-native applications locally before deploying to production.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This tutorial demonstrates:
1. Multi-service AWS integration with LocalStack
2. Event-driven architecture patterns
3. Serverless application development
4. Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation
5. Modern frontend/backend development practices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core AWS Services (Emulated)
- **API Gateway** - RESTful API endpoints
- **Lambda** - Serverless compute functions
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database
- **S3** - File storage for product images
- **Cognito** - Authentication and user management
- **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure provisioning

### Service Interactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- AWS CLI configured for LocalStack

### One-Command Setup
```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
git clone https://github.com/Akashbellary/ekart-aws-localstack.git
cd ekart-aws-localstack
```
### To run the project using python scripts
```bash
#cleanup the existing lambda functions (optinal)
python scripts\cleanup-serverless.py 

#Run this to deploy the dynamodb, s3 backets, IAM Role, API Gateway
python scripts\deploy-infrastructure.py

#Deploy Lambda functions
python scripts\deploy-serverless.py    

#Seed the sample products data
python scripts\seed.py      

#Test script. Tests involving extensions may not work for free version of localstack
python scripts\test-serverless-apis.py

#If frontend fails to work, run this script. This fixes api config to work with frontend.
python scripts\configure-frontend.py 
```

### Manual Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
make install

# 2. Start LocalStack
docker-compose up -d localstack

# 3. Deploy infrastructure
make deploy-infra

# 4. Seed sample data
make seed-data

# 5. Start services
make start
```

## üîß Key Components Explained

### 1. Order Processing Workflow

**Problem Identified**: Orders weren't appearing in the orders list after successful payment due to incomplete integration between payment processing and order creation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced payment processor Lambda to handle both payment intents and order creation
- Added proper linking between payment intents and orders in DynamoDB
- Updated frontend to collect shipping information and pass it during payment confirmation

**Workflow**:
1. User adds items to cart
2. Proceeds to checkout with shipping information
3. Frontend calls `/api/payments/create-payment-intent` to create payment
4. After payment confirmation, frontend calls `/api/payments/confirm-payment`
5. Payment processor creates order in DynamoDB and links it to payment intent
6. Orders are now visible in the `/orders` page

### 2. Data Models

#### Orders Table (`ekart-orders-dev`)
- Primary Key: `order_id`
- GSI: `buyer_id` and `seller_id` for efficient querying
- Fields: items, total_amount, status, payment_status, shipping_address

#### Products Table (`ekart-products-dev`)
- Primary Key: `product_id`
- GSI: `seller_id` and `category` for filtering
- Fields: title, description, price, stock_quantity, images

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and get JWT token

#### Products
- `GET /api/products` - List products
- `POST /api/products` - Create product (sellers)
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get product details
- `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product (sellers)

#### Cart
- `GET /api/cart` - Get user's cart
- `POST /api/cart/items` - Add item to cart
- `PUT /api/cart/items/{id}` - Update item quantity
- `DELETE /api/cart/items/{id}` - Remove item from cart

#### Payments
- `POST /api/payments/create-payment-intent` - Create payment intent
- `POST /api/payments/confirm-payment` - Confirm payment and create order

#### Orders
- `GET /api/orders` - List user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/{id}` - Get order details
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/status` - Update order status (sellers)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Install all dependencies
make install

# Start all services
make start

# Stop all services
make stop

# Redeploy infrastructure
make deploy-infra

# Seed database with sample data
make seed-data

# Run tests
make test

# Clean up environment
make clean
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Orders Not Showing After Payment
**Cause**: Previous implementation didn't link payment confirmation with order creation
**Fix**: Updated payment processor Lambda to create orders when payments are confirmed

### LocalStack Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check LocalStack health
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health

# Restart LocalStack
make stop && make start
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check DynamoDB tables
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 dynamodb list-tables

# Check table contents
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 dynamodb scan --table-name ekart-orders-dev
```
